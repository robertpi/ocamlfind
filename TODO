Feature wish (Renieris):
	basic ocamldoc support

Error: 
	ocamlfind -I +pkg outputs a warning.

Feature wish: ocamlfind printconf -sh
	Prints the configuration such that it can be sourced from sh.

Feature wish: (zack)
	-ldconf /path/to/ldconf
		Changes the path of the ld.conf to modify
	-create-ldconf
		Creates ld.conf if it does not exist

ocamlfind ocamldoc: understands -package, but not more.

Subpackages: META files may define several packages. Subpackages
have names <mainpkg>.<subpkg>. Syntax in META:
	<main package decls>
	[<mainpkg>.<subpkg>]
	<decls for this subpackage>
	[<mainpkg>.<subpkg>]
	<decls for this subpackage>
	...
"." is no longer allowed in package names (reserved as delimiter).
Besides having a name component in common with the main package,
subpackages are independent entities. There are no relations to
the main package except the declared ones. (Exception: Directory
location is inherited.)

Directives #thread and #vmthread for the toploop.
#predicate.

Fix: num-top

Negated predicates in declarations, e.g.
archive(byte,feature) = "..."
archive(byte,-feature) = "..."

Fix syntax:
+pkg searches in stdlib
=pkg performs a findlib package lookup

error(pred,...) = "message": if predicates are true, an error is
indicated

package predicates: If pkg is selected, the predicate pkg_<name> is
automatically set.

Operator += in META, e.g.
var(pred) = "base def"
var(pred,feature) += "additional def"
"+=" definitions are appended to the single base definition. In contrast
to "=", _all_ matching definitions are selected, not only the best matching.
