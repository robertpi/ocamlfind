Feature wish (Renieris):
	basic ocamldoc support

Error: 
	ocamlfind -I +pkg outputs a warning.

Feature wish: ocamlfind printconf -sh
	Prints the configuration such that it can be sourced from sh.

Feature wish: (zack)
	-ldconf /path/to/ldconf
		Changes the path of the ld.conf to modify
	-create-ldconf
		Creates ld.conf if it does not exist

Support for libexec:
	config option: ldconfpolicy = (donttouch|repository|package)
		(default: package)
	donttouch: ld.conf is never modified
	package: current behaviour
	repository: every repository has a directory libexec containing
		symlinks to the DLLs. when a package is installed:
		- no libexec dir: create one and populate it. Remove
		  all other package dirs from ld.conf
		- Put (relative) symlink into libexec, done.
		When a package is removed:
		- Check whether there is a libexec dir, and remove symlinks
		  pointing to the package directory.
