Feature wish (Renieris):
	basic ocamldoc support

Feature wish: (zack)
	-ldconf /path/to/ldconf
		Changes the path of the ld.conf to modify
	-create-ldconf
		Creates ld.conf if it does not exist

ocamlfind ocamldoc: understands -package, but not more.

Directives #thread and #vmthread for the toploop.
#predicate.

Fix: num-top

- Fertig -------------------------------------------------------------

Subpackages: META files may define several packages. Subpackages
have names <mainpkg>.<subpkg>. Syntax in META:
	<main package decls>
	[<mainpkg>.<subpkg>]
	<decls for this subpackage>
	[<mainpkg>.<subpkg>]
	<decls for this subpackage>
	...
"." is no longer allowed in package names (reserved as delimiter).
Besides having a name component in common with the main package,
subpackages are independent entities. There are no relations to
the main package except the declared ones. (Exception: Directory
location is inherited.)
DONE

Negated predicates in declarations, e.g.
archive(byte,feature) = "..."
archive(byte,-feature) = "..."
DONE

Fix syntax:
+pkg searches in stdlib
@pkg performs a findlib package lookup
DONE

error(pred,...) = "message": if predicates are true, an error is
indicated
DONE

package predicates: If pkg is selected, the predicate pkg_<name> is
automatically set. (for archive and linkopts)
DONE

Operator += in META, e.g.
var(pred) = "base def"
var(pred,feature) += "additional def"
"+=" definitions are appended to the single base definition. In contrast
to "=", _all_ matching definitions are selected, not only the best matching.
DONE

Remove: mt modules
DONE

Fix:
ocamlfind ocamlopt -thread" must not generate the flag -vmthread on
vmthread-only systems, but signal an error.
DONE

======================================================================
Changes:
======================================================================

Findlib:
	- init_manually has additional () arg
	- exceptions No_such_package, Package_loop

ocamlfind:
	- "guess" removed
	- ocamlfind query -descendants:  The predicates are now
	  taken into account (they were ignored in previous releases)
	- ocamlfind query -r -d -l
	- Syntax "+dir" and "@pkg": is recognized at more places:
	  After -I, in "archive" settings, as normal file arguments
